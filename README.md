# Coverage-and-energy-efficient-routing-optimization-in-WSNs
This project explores and compares optimization methods for improving coverage and energy-efficient routing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It evaluates coverage, energy consumption, and network lifetime to identify effective strategies for WSN performance enhancement.

Coverage problem and energy-efficient routing problem in WSNs is optimized using the Puma optimization algorithm. 
To run for coverage problem: Puma, exploitation, exploration, boundaryCheck, Calculate_Cost, and main_for_coverage_problem. 
To run for the energy-efficient routing problem: Puma, exploitation, exploration, boundaryCheck, ObjectiveFunction, and main_for_energy-efficient_routing.
